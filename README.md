Arduino code for Creative Engineering Design 2019

This project was designed for a Creative Engineering Design project where we made a device to wake people up better. The Arduino code controls the motors, a MP3 module, LED strips, and a heat pad to stimulate the person into waking up naturally. We provide customization with Bluetooth connection and an app to send information. The user can not only set the time they want to wake up, but also customize the strength of stimuli or turn it off entirely.
